# OldScriptSample

This repo holds a prime sample of scripts I spent developing for specific projects in academia. 
It's worth knowing that the scripts are culminations of work and each section had many iterations and testing phases
to ensure statistical compliance with the data being altered.

These scripts are nowhere near exhaustive, but are likely the best representations of programming I developed entirely with minimal instruction and purpose driven.
